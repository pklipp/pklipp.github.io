I laid out my learning plan in my [last post]({% post_url 2015-03-26-Creating-My-UX-Learnin-Plan %}), including growth hacking, copywriting, design thinking, design ethnography, and front-end development. After much searching, here are the books or courses that I've decided to use to get started learning what I'll need to know to become the UX/product manager that [Kanbanery](http://kanbanery.com) needs me to be.

**Design Thinking**

[![Designing For Growth Book Cover]({{ pklipp.github.io }}/assets/1.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Growth-Thinking-Managers-Publishing/dp/0231158386/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1427444930&sr=8-4&keywords=design+thinking)

This one was a no-brainer for me. Jeanne Liedtka and Tim Ogilvie's [Designing for Growth](http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Growth-Thinking-Managers-Publishing/dp/0231158386/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1427444930&sr=8-4&keywords=design+thinking) seems to be the go-to book for learning the basics of design thinking. 

**Copywriting**

[![Copywriting Books]({{ pklipp.github.io }}/assets/2.png)](http://copyhackers.com/shop/)

I'm looking for something practical, aimed at the kind of work I plan to be doing. [This series](http://copyhackers.com/shop/), by Joanna Weibe, looks like just the thing. I bought the whole series and my plan is to read one book a week, implement its suggestions, and write a book review and share the results of my efforts on this blog.

**Front-end Development**

This will be a long process, and I'm starting simple. My plan is to create a new website for my [annual IT conference](http://aceconf.com/) from scratch as a way to practice my skills. To get started in CSS and JavaScript, I've bought [these two courses](https://www.udemy.com/1-hour-css/) from Udemy.

[![One Hour CSS and JS Udemy Courses]({{ pklipp.github.io }}/assets/3.png)](https://www.udemy.com/1-hour-css/)

I watched them both in a morning, doing the exercises along with John. I learned a few things that are helpful, but not enough to get started on any project. To dig deeper, I plan to do [this more in-depth course](https://www.udemy.com/complete-web-developer-course/).

**Design Ethnography**

[![Practical Ethnography]({{ pklipp.github.io }}/assets/5.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Ethnography-Guide-Private-Sector/dp/1611323908/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1427446174&sr=8-1-spell&keywords=practical+ethnogrpaphy)

I've already read and highly recommend Sam Ladner's recent book [Practical Ethnography](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Ethnography-Guide-Private-Sector/dp/1611323908/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1427446174&sr=8-1-spell&keywords=practical+ethnogrpaphy), which was both inspiring and highly practical.

[![Interviewing Users]({{ pklipp.github.io }}/assets/6.jpg)](http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/interviewing-users/)

For more advice on talking to users, I've also bought Steve Portigal's [Interviewing Users](http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/interviewing-users/). By the way, I highly recommend buying ebooks from [Rosenfeld Media's website](http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/), rather than from Amazon. Sure, they don't get automatically added to your Kindle, but if you buy an ebook from Rosenfeld's site, you can download it in several formats. I especially like having a PDF format for books with worksheets or exercises that I plan to do at the office.

[![The UX Team of One]({{ pklipp.github.io }}/assets/7.jpg)](http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/the-user-experience-team-of-one/)

Finally, I've started reading another Rosenfeld Media book, [The User Experience Team of One](http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/the-user-experience-team-of-one/) by Leah Buley which I'm finding to be full of really helpful exercises that I plan to do. After a section of introduction to concepts, the book becomes a workbook full of exercises that I can start doing immediately. That's very appealing, because it means that I can act and add value to [Kanbanery](http://kanbanery.com/) while learning.

I also subscribe to [Current Anthropology](http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/journals/journal/ca.html), [Anthropology of Work Review](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1548-1417), and [Human Organization](http://www.sfaa.net/publications/human-organization/), just to stay abreast of developments in my field. I'll admit that I tend to find the research procedures more interesting than the findings, as they give me ideas for structuring my own research.

**Growth Hacking**

[![Growth Hacking Course]({{ pklipp.github.io }}/assets/8.png)](https://www.udemy.com/growth-hacking-lean-marketing-for-startups/#/)

My introduction to growth hacking comes from [these two courses](https://www.udemy.com/growth-hacking-lean-marketing-for-startups/#/) that I'm working through on Udemy.  Both have helpful insights and I'll share the results of the experiments that I've done and will do.

**Sketching**

[![Sketching User Experiences]({{ pklipp.github.io }}/assets/11.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/Sketching-User-Experiences-Interactive-Technologies/dp/0123740371/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1427447188&sr=1-2&keywords=sketching+user+experiences)
[![The Back of the Napkin]({{ pklipp.github.io }}/assets/10.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/Back-Napkin-Expanded-Problems-Pictures/dp/1591842697/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1427447240&sr=1-1&keywords=back+of+the+napkin)
[![The Sketchnote Handbook]({{ pklipp.github.io }}/assets/9.png)](http://rohdesign.com/handbook)


Anyone can draw! Mike Rhode's [The Sketchnote Handbook](http://rohdesign.com/handbook) looks like a fun and painless introduction to sketching for everyone, and it's where I'll start. Other interesting titles include [Sketching User Experiences](http://www.amazon.com/Sketching-User-Experiences-Interactive-Technologies/dp/0123740371/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1427447188&sr=1-2&keywords=sketching+user+experiences) by Bill Buxton and [The Back of the Napkin](http://www.amazon.com/Back-Napkin-Expanded-Problems-Pictures/dp/1591842697/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1427447240&sr=1-1&keywords=back+of+the+napkin) by Dan Roam.

And that's enough for now. I'd love other recommendations for books and blogs that have been helpful for you.
