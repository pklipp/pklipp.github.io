Conferences</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

Melissa Perri’s keynote at ACE! last month was a big part of what inspired me to develop my product management skill set. It’s well worth a watch.

Product Management is an art of balancing customer needs with creating business value. Unfortunately; many of the tools and values we have as Product Managers do not focus on building products our customers need; but building what we “think” they will want. In this talk; we’ll look at traditional Product Management; and see how we can adapt Lean processes into the role to create better products for our customers. We’ll rethink our most common tools to better suit a customer focused approach; with plenty of example and real life stories.
