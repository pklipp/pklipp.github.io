  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I laid out my learning plan in my <a href="/general/2015/03/26/Creating-My-UX-Learnin-Plan.html">last post</a>, including growth hacking, copywriting, design thinking, design ethnography, and front-end development. After much searching, here are the books or courses that I’ve decided to use to get started learning what I’ll need to know to become the UX/product manager that <a href="http://kanbanery.com">Kanbanery</a> needs me to be.</p>

<p><strong>Design Thinking</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Growth-Thinking-Managers-Publishing/dp/0231158386/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427444930&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=design+thinking"><img src="/assets/1.jpg" alt="Designing For Growth Book Cover" /></a></p>

<p>This one was a no-brainer for me. Jeanne Liedtka and Tim Ogilvie’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Growth-Thinking-Managers-Publishing/dp/0231158386/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427444930&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=design+thinking">Designing for Growth</a> seems to be the go-to book for learning the basics of design thinking.</p>

<p><strong>Copywriting</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://copyhackers.com/shop/"><img src="/assets/2.png" alt="Copywriting Books" /></a></p>

<p>I’m looking for something practical, aimed at the kind of work I plan to be doing. <a href="http://copyhackers.com/shop/">This series</a>, by Joanna Weibe, looks like just the thing. I bought the whole series and my plan is to read one book a week, implement its suggestions, and write a book review and share the results of my efforts on this blog.</p>

<p><strong>Front-end Development</strong></p>

<p>This will be a long process, and I’m starting simple. My plan is to create a new website for my <a href="http://aceconf.com/">annual IT conference</a> from scratch as a way to practice my skills. To get started in CSS and JavaScript, I’ve bought <a href="https://www.udemy.com/1-hour-css/">these two courses</a> from Udemy.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/1-hour-css/"><img src="/assets/3.png" alt="One Hour CSS and JS Udemy Courses" /></a></p>

<p>I watched them both in a morning, doing the exercises along with John. I learned a few things that are helpful, but not enough to get started on any project. To dig deeper, I plan to do <a href="https://www.udemy.com/complete-web-developer-course/">this more in-depth course</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/complete-web-developer-course/"><img src="/assets/4.png" alt="The Complete Web Developer Course" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Design Ethnography</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Ethnography-Guide-Private-Sector/dp/1611323908/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427446174&amp;sr=8-1-spell&amp;keywords=practical+ethnogrpaphy"><img src="/assets/5.jpg" alt="Practical Ethnography" /></a></p>

<p>I’ve already read and highly recommend Sam Ladner’s recent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Ethnography-Guide-Private-Sector/dp/1611323908/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427446174&amp;sr=8-1-spell&amp;keywords=practical+ethnogrpaphy">Practical Ethnography</a>, which was both inspiring and highly practical.</p>

<p><a href="http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/interviewing-users/"><img src="/assets/6.jpg" alt="Interviewing Users" /></a></p>

<p>For more advice on talking to users, I’ve also bought Steve Portigal’s <a href="http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/interviewing-users/">Interviewing Users</a>. By the way, I highly recommend buying ebooks from <a href="http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/">Rosenfeld Media’s website</a>, rather than from Amazon. Sure, they don’t get automatically added to your Kindle, but if you buy an ebook from Rosenfeld’s site, you can download it in several formats. I especially like having a PDF format for books with worksheets or exercises that I plan to do at the office.</p>

<p><a href="http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/the-user-experience-team-of-one/"><img src="/assets/7.jpg" alt="The UX Team of One" /></a></p>

<p>Finally, I’ve started reading another Rosenfeld Media book, <a href="http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/the-user-experience-team-of-one/">The User Experience Team of One</a> by Leah Buley which I’m finding to be full of really helpful exercises that I plan to do. After a section of introduction to concepts, the book becomes a workbook full of exercises that I can start doing immediately. That’s very appealing, because it means that I can act and add value to <a href="http://kanbanery.com/">Kanbanery</a> while learning.</p>

<p>I also subscribe to <a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/journals/journal/ca.html">Current Anthropology</a>, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1548-1417">Anthropology of Work Review</a>, and <a href="http://www.sfaa.net/publications/human-organization/">Human Organization</a>, just to stay abreast of developments in my field. I’ll admit that I tend to find the research procedures more interesting than the findings, as they give me ideas for structuring my own research.</p>

<p><strong>Growth Hacking</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/growth-hacking-lean-marketing-for-startups/#/"><img src="/assets/8.png" alt="Growth Hacking Course" /></a></p>

<p>My introduction to growth hacking comes from <a href="https://www.udemy.com/growth-hacking-lean-marketing-for-startups/#/">these two courses</a> that I’m working through on Udemy.  Both have helpful insights and I’ll share the results of the experiments that I’ve done and will do.</p>

<p><strong>Sketching</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sketching-User-Experiences-Interactive-Technologies/dp/0123740371/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427447188&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=sketching+user+experiences"><img src="/assets/11.jpg" alt="Sketching User Experiences" /></a>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Back-Napkin-Expanded-Problems-Pictures/dp/1591842697/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427447240&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=back+of+the+napkin"><img src="/assets/10.jpg" alt="The Back of the Napkin" /></a>
<a href="http://rohdesign.com/handbook"><img src="/assets/9.png" alt="The Sketchnote Handbook" /></a></p>

<p>Anyone can draw! Mike Rhode’s <a href="http://rohdesign.com/handbook">The Sketchnote Handbook</a> looks like a fun and painless introduction to sketching for everyone, and it’s where I’ll start. Other interesting titles include <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sketching-User-Experiences-Interactive-Technologies/dp/0123740371/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427447188&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=sketching+user+experiences">Sketching User Experiences</a> by Bill Buxton and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Back-Napkin-Expanded-Problems-Pictures/dp/1591842697/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427447240&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=back+of+the+napkin">The Back of the Napkin</a> by Dan Roam.</p>

<p>And that’s enough for now. I’d love other recommendations for books and blogs that have been helpful for you.</p>
